        overview: "Lamyata (Bulgarian for “The Dragon”) is a modern gastropub that celebrates bold flavors, fire-grilled dishes, and a gritty urban vibe. The goal of this project was to create a cohesive brand identity that embodies the raw energy of flame-cooked food while appealing to a digitally connected, social-media-driven audience.",
        conceptVisualLanguage: "The core concept revolves around the slavic folklore presented in a modern way. A custom logomark features a stylized “Lamya” for the top and transforms into burger, symbolizing both the name and the food style. The color palette—dominated by deep reds, black, and charred textures—evokes fire, smoke, and rich, grilled flavor.",

        overview: "Връх (Bulgarian for “Peak”) is a conceptual beer brand that captures the spirit of nature, adventure, and handcrafted brewing. Designed with a rugged yet minimalistic aesthetic, this branding project aims to resonate with outdoorsy, quality-conscious consumers who value authenticity and visual storytelling. The project creates a unified identity across packaging, merchandise, and corporate stationery, elevating the brand into a lifestyle beyond beer.",
        conceptVisualLanguage: "The core concept is built around the motif of mountain exploration and Bulgarian natural landscapes, interpreted through a contemporary design lens. The custom logotype 'ВРЪХ' is stark and geometric, evoking stamped labels or alpine signage. A consistent mountain-scape illustration runs through all product variants, creating visual continuity across STOUT, CRAFT, and LAGER styles. The use of black, white, and muted natural tones—punctuated by bold accent colors (green, teal, amber)—represents the raw purity of ingredients and the elevation experience. The packaging and visuals exude calm strength, wild purity, and clean design, reflecting both the environment and product quality.",

        overview: "il Diavolo is a bold and dramatic brand identity concept for a premium wine label and lifestyle product line.

This project creates a cohesive identity system that appeals to thrill-seekers, design aficionados, and connoisseurs looking for more than just a drink—an experience.",
        conceptVisualLanguage: "The visual concept draws inspiration from infernal mythology and vintage ink illustration. A muscular devil figure holding a trident becomes the core brand character, illustrated in a fine, hand-drawn style with a modern twist. The logo features an expressive handwritten script for “Diavolo” with aggressive brushstroke accents and a red slash through the name—symbolizing danger, passion, and high energy. The overall color palette—white, deep black, and bold crimson red—evokes intensity, heat, and elegance. The branding balances traditional textures (grainy, hand-inked) with confident modern typography and layout.",
